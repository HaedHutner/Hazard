# Hazard

Far in the future, beyond the 30th century, a long-forgotten military base on Mars experiences a sudden resurge of power. Why this is, who can say, but the resulting shock fries the barely-functioning computer and forces an emergency protocol to open the few still functional cryopods remaining.

All but one are filled with corpses. And from within, emerges Oberleutnant Erhard Heller, the last remaining soldier of what was once NATO. Though long defeated by the alien species known as the Zud, most of NATO's secret bases remained undiscovered and well-hidden by the marsian dust. The only thing keeping this one barely functional is it's hacked together connection to the planetary power grid, though whoever achieved this marvel of impromptu engineering is long gone.

With his rediscovered ( and quite old-fashioned ) Beretta 92FS, Lt. Heller's mission is to find out what became of humanity.
